## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development

```bash
yarn dev
```
**Note:** If the error "digital envelope routines::unsupported" appears and the build fails, correct this by enabling the legacy OpenSSL provider.

On Unix-like, enter the command:

```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

## Static Generation

This will create the `dist/` directory for publishing to static hosting:

```bash
yarn generate
```

To preview the static generated app, run `yarn start`
