A public instance of Rekor can be found at [rekor.sigstore.dev](https://rekor.sigstore.dev). The public instance offers an SLO
of 99.5% availability and is monitored by an oncall team.

## Auditing the Public Instance

Rekor is built on top of a [verifiable data structure](https://transparency.dev/verifiable-data-structures/). Auditors
can monitor the log for consistency, meaning that the log remains append-only and entries are never mutated or removed.
Verifiers can also monitor the log for their identities.
Learn more about transparency logs [here](https://transparency.dev/), and about binary transparency [here](https://binary.transparency.dev/).

There are few options for auditing and monitoring the Rekor log. We've built a monitor that runs on GitHub Actions,
[Rekor monitor](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor-monitor). Follow the instructions to set up a new repository and
use the [provided reusable workflow](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor-monitor/blob/main/.github/workflows/reusable_monitoring.yml)
to audit the log. You can also monitor the log for specified identities, though
this feature is a work in progress and supports a limited set of identities and entry types.

You can also run [omniwitness](https://github.com/transparency-dev/witness/tree/main/cmd/omniwitness) to
audit the log, built by the team who created Trillian, which provides Rekor's verifiable log.
