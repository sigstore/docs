# Admission Controller

The `policy-controller` admission controller can be used to enforce policy on a Kubernetes cluster based on verifiable supply-chain metadata from `cosign`.

`policy-controller` also resolves the image tags to ensure the image being ran is not different from when it was admitted.

See the [installation instructions](installation) for more information.

**This component is still actively under development!**

Today, `policy-controller` can automatically validate signatures and
attestations on container images.
Enforcement is configured on a per-namespace basis, and multiple keys are supported.

We're actively working on more features here.

## Enable policy-controller admission controller for namespaces

The `policy-controller` admission controller will only validate resources in namespaces
that have chosen to opt-in. This can be done by adding the label
`policy.sigstore.dev/include: "true"` to the namespace resource.

```bash
kubectl label namespace my-secure-namespace policy.sigstore.dev/include=true
```

## Admission of images

An image is admitted after it has been validated against all `ClusterImagePolicy` that matched the digest of the image
and that there was at least one valid signature or attestation obtained from the authorities provided in each of the matched `ClusterImagePolicy`.
So each `ClusterImagePolicy` that matches is `AND` for admission, and within each `ClusterImagePolicy` authorities
are `OR`.

Review [Configuring Image Pattern](#configuring-image-patterns) for more information.

An example of an allowed admission would be:
1. If the image matched against `policy1` and `policy3`
1. A valid signature or attestation was obtained for `policy1` with at least one of the `policy1` authorities
1. A valid signature or attestation was obtained for `policy3` with at least one of the `policy3` authorities
1. The image is admitted

An example of a denied admission would be:
1. If the image matched against `policy1` and `policy2`
1. A valid signature or attestation was obtained for `policy1` with at least one of the `policy1` authorities
1. No valid signature or attestation was obtained for `policy2` with at least one of the `policy2` authorities
1. The image is not admitted

In addition to that, the policy controller offers a configurable behavior defining whether to allow, deny or warn whenever an image does not match a policy. This behavior can be configured using the `config-policy-controller` ConfigMap created under the release namespace, and by adding an entry with the property `no-match-policy` and its value `warn|allow|deny`.
By default, any image that does not match a policy is rejected whenever `no-match-policy` is not configured in the ConfigMap.

## Configuring policy-controller `ClusterImagePolicy`

`policy-controller` supports validation against multiple `ClusterImagePolicy` Kubernetes resources.

A policy is enforced when an image pattern for the policy is matched against the image being deployed.

### Configuring image patterns

The `ClusterImagePolicy` specifies `spec.images` which specifies a list of `glob` matching patterns.
These matching patterns will be matched against the image digest of PodSpec resources attempting to be deployed.

Glob uses golang [filepath](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match) semantics for
matching the images against. Additionally you can specify a more traditional
`**` to match any number of characters. Furthermore to make it easier to specify
 images, there are few defaults when an image is matched, namely:
 * If there is no host in the glob pattern `index.docker.io` is used for the host. This allows users to specify commonly found images from Docker simply as myproject/nginx instead of inded.docker.io/myproject/nginx
 * If the image is specified without multiple path elements (so not separated by `/`), then `library` is defaulted. For example specifying `busybox` will result in library/busybox. And combined with above, will result in match being made against `index.docker.io/library/busybox`.

A sample of a `ClusterImagePolicy` which matches against all images using glob:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: image-policy
spec:
  images:
  - glob: "**"
```

### Authorities

When a policy is selected to be evaluated against the matched image, the
authorities will be used to validate signatures and attestations.
If at least one authority is satisfied and a signature or attestation is
validated, the policy is validated.

### Configuring `key` authorities

Authorities can be `key` specifications, for example:

```yaml
spec:
  authorities:
    - key:
        hashAlgorithm: sha256
        data: |
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          ...
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
    - key:
        secretRef:
          name: secretName
    - key:
        kms: KMSPATH
```

Each `key` authority can contain these properties:
- `key.data`: specifies the plain text string of the public key
- `key.hashAlgorithm` (optional): specifies the signature digest for the key, e.g. `sha512`, `sha256`, `sha384` or `sha224`. If no value is provided the hash algorith is set by default to `sha256`.
- `key.secretRef.name`: specifies the secret location name in the same namespace where `policy-controller` is installed. <br/> The first key value will be used in the secret.
- `key.kms`: specifies the location for the public key. Supported formats include:
  - `azurekms://[VAULT_NAME][VAULT_URI]/[KEY]`
  - `awskms://[ENDPOINT]/{ARN}` where `ARN` can be either key ARN or alias ARN.
  - `gcpkms://projects/[PROJECT]/locations/global/keyRings/[KEYRING]/cryptoKeys/[KEY]`
  - `hashivault://[KEY]`

### Configuring `keyless` authorities

Authorities can be `keyless` specifications. For example:

```yaml
spec:
  authorities:
    - keyless:
        url: https://fulcio.example.com
        ca-cert:
          data: Certificate Data
    - keyless:
        url: https://fulcio.example.com
        ca-cert:
          secretRef:
            name: secretName
    - keyless:
        identities:
          - issuer: https://accounts.google.com
            subject: foo@example.com
          - issuer: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
            subjectRegExp: https://github.com/mycompany/*/.github/workflows/*@*

```

Each `keyless` authority can contain these properties:
- `keyless.url`: specifies the Fulcio url
- `keyless.ca-cert`: specifies `ca-cert` information for the `keyless` authority
  - `secretRef.name`: specifies the secret location name in the same namespace where `policy-controller` is installed. <br/>The first key value will be used in the secret for the `ca-cert`.
  - `data`: specifies the inline certificate data
- `keyless.identities`: Identity may contain an array of `issuer` and/or the `subject` found in the transparency log. There are
variant fields `issuerRegExp` and `subjectRegExp` which support
regular expressions.
  - `issuer`: specifies the issuer found in the transparency log. Regex patterns are supported through the `issuerRegExp` key.
  - `subject`: specifies the subject found in the transparency log. Regex patterns are supported through the `subjectRegExp` key.

### Configuring `static` authorities

Authorities can be `static` specifications. These are used for example when
there are images that may not have any signatures or attestations (sidecar is
one example of these). For these you can configure a `static` authority and you
can define an action to take. Currently we support `pass` and `fail`, and when
a `static` authority is evaluated, no signatures or attestations are checked,
but instead the `action` specified defines whether the policy is validated or
rejected.

You can also use a generic catch-all CIP that matches all images. For example, if
you want to allow all unsigned images through, but have certain images that must
have signatures/attestations, you can then for those images create other CIP
that is more restrictive, and since the CIP are all anded together they will
then be required to meet all the CIP requirements.

A sample authority that allows all images from a particular registry could be
defined like so:

```yaml
spec:
  images:
    - glob: "gcr.io/vaikas/**"
  authorities:
    - static:
      action: pass
```

### Configuring remote signature location

If signatures are located in a different repository, it can be specified along with the `key` or `keyless` definition.
When no `source` is specified for the key, the expectation is that the signature is colocated with the image.

**Note:** By default, credentials used for the remote source repository are the ones provided in the PodSpec providing resource under `imagePullSecrets`.

To define a `source`, under the corresponding `authorities` node, `source` can be specified.

A sample of source specification for `key` and `keyless`:

```yaml
spec:
  authorities:
    - key:
        data: |
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          ...
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
      source:
        - oci: registry.example.com/project/signature-location
    - keyless:
        url: https://fulcio.example.com
      source:
        - oci: registry.example.com/project/signature-location
```

### Configure `SignaturePullSecrets`

If the signatures / attestations are in a different repo or they use different
PullSecrets, you can configure `source` to point to a `secret` which must live
in the same namespace as `policy-controller` webhook (by default `cosign-system`).

```yaml
spec:
  authorities:
    - key:
        data: |
          -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
          ...
          -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
      source:
        - oci: registry.example.com/project/signature-location
    - keyless:
        url: https://fulcio.example.com
      source:
        - oci: registry.example.com/project/signature-location
          signaturePullSecrets:
          - name: mysecret
```

**Note:** The secret has to be in the format `type: dockerconfigjson`.

### Configuring Certificate Transparency Log

CTLog specifies the URL to a certificate transparency log that holds signature
and public key information.

When `ctlog` key is not specified, the public rekor instance will be used.

```yaml
spec:
  authorities:
    - keyless:
        url: https://fulcio.example.com
      ctlog:
        url: https://rekor.example.com
```

### Configuring policy that validates attestations

Just like with `cosign` CLI you can verify attestations (using `verify-attestation`),
you can configure policies to validate that a particular attestation was signed by
a trusted authority as well as that the attestation passes the policy you
define. You do this by using `attestations` array within an `authorities`
section. For example, to configure that a `custom` predicate has to exist and is
attested by the specified `issuer` and `subject`, and the actual `Data` section
of the predicate matches the string `foobar e2e test`:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: image-policy-keyless-with-attestations
spec:
  images:
  - glob: registry.local:5000/policy-controller/demo*
  authorities:
  - name: verify custom attestation
    keyless:
      url: http://fulcio.fulcio-system.svc
      identities:
      - issuerRegExp: .*kubernetes.default.*
        subjectRegExp: .*kubernetes.io/namespaces/default/serviceaccounts/default
    ctlog:
      url: http://rekor.rekor-system.svc
    attestations:
    - name: custom-match-predicate
      predicateType: custom
      policy:
        type: cue
        data: |
          predicateType: "cosign.sigstore.dev/attestation/v1"
          predicate: Data: "foobar e2e test"
```

`policy` is optional and if left out, only the existence of the attestation is
verified.

## Configuring policy at the `ClusterImagePolicy` level.

As discussed earlier, by specifying multiple `ClusterImagePolicy` creates an `AND`
clause so that each `ClusterImagePolicy` must be satisfied for an admission, and
having multiple `authorities` creates an `OR` clause so that any matching `authority`
is considered a success, sometimes you may want more flexibility, for example, if you
wanted to specify that at least 2 out of N signatures match, and for those you
can create a single `ClusterImagePolicy` but craft a `policy` that then gets applied
after a `ClusterImagePolicy` has been validated and at least one of the
authorities matches.

You can also utilize the CIP level policy to fetch additional information about
the specific Kubernetes resource being created that will then be available
for the CIP level policy, for example:

 * Apply policies against ObjectMetadata (things like labels, annotations for
   example)
 * Spec which has details about the resource being created. For example
   Pod.Spec, which has details like which serviceAccount the Pod is being run as
   and so forth.
 * [OCI Image Configuration](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/config.md)
   which contains root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution
   parameters for use within a container runtime.

Here is a slightly more complex policy that shows how one could craft more
complex policies at the CIP level that then validates that the more specific
authority policies are as expected. It requires there to be two attestations
`custom` and `vuln` and also two signatures, one signed with a `key` and one
with `keyless` signature.


```yaml
apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy

          before: time.Parse(time.RFC3339, "2049-10-09T17:10:27Z")
          predicateType: "cosign.sigstore.dev/attestation/v1"
          predicate: {
            Data: "foobar e2e test"
            Timestamp: <before
          }
    - predicateType: vuln

          after: time.Parse(time.RFC3339, "2022-03-09T17:10:27Z")
          predicateType: "cosign.sigstore.dev/attestation/vuln/v1"
          predicate: {

### Including OCI Image Configuration for CIP level policies

In order to include the OCI Image Configuration, you have to explicitly
configure the CIP.Spec.Policy to have `fetchConfigFile` set to `true`. For
example, to configure a check that the container image is being run as a user
`65532` on `linux/amd64` arch, you would configure your CIP like this:

```
apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: image-policy-config-file
spec:
  images:
  - glob: "ghcr.io/sigstore/timestamp-server**"
  authorities:
  - static:
      action: pass
  policy:
    fetchConfigFile: true
    type: "cue"
    data: |
      config: "linux/amd64": config: User: "65532"
```

### Including ObjectMeta for CIP level policies

In order to include the ObjectMeta, you have to explicitly configure the
CIP.Spec.Policy to have `includeObjectMeta` set to `true`. For example, to
configure a check that the resource contains a label `foo=bar`, you would
configure your CIP like this:

```
apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: image-policy-objectmeta
spec:
  images:
  - glob: "ghcr.io/sigstore/timestamp-server**"
  authorities:
  - static:
      action: pass
  policy:
    includeObjectMeta: true
    type: "cue"
    data: |
      objectMeta: "labels": "foo": "bar"
```

### Including Spec for CIP level policies

In order to include the objects Spec, you have to explicitly configure the
CIP.Spec.Policy to have `includeSpec` set to `true`. For example, to configure a
check that the pod runs as serviceAccount `default`, you would configure your
CIP like this:

```
apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: image-spec
spec:
  images:
  - glob: "ghcr.io/sigstore/timestamp-server**"
  authorities:
  - static:
      action: pass
  policy:
    includeSpec: true
    type: "cue"
    data: |
      spec: "serviceAccount": "default"
```

*NOTE* For Spec, you may want to use MatchResource to restrict which resources
you want to apply the CIP to since the Spec will be different between say a
`Deployment` and a `Pod`.

## Controlling warn vs. enforce behaviour

When creating a `ClusterImagePolicy` by default when a policy fails to meet
the requirements, it will not be admitted. However, sometimes folks want to
allow these through, but warn the user about the fact that this operation did
not meet the criteria. For this you can use a `mode` configuration option for
a specific policy. When set to `warn`, it will not block the admission, but
instead will allow it through and emit a warning.

For example:
```
apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: image-policy-keyless-warn
spec:
  mode: warn
  images:
  - glob: registry.local:5000/policy-controller/demo*
  authorities:
  - keyless:
      url: http://fulcio.fulcio-system.svc
    ctlog:
      url: http://rekor.rekor-system.svc
```
 By specifying the `spec.mode` as `warn`, even if an image is found to be not
 compliant, it will be allowed through, but a warning is issued to the caller
 informing them that this is not a compliant image.

## Policies matching specific resource types and labels

The `ClusterImagePolicy` supports a new field that defines which type of core resources a policy will enforce against the defined authorities for a given glob pattern.

The following is an example of a `ClusterImagePolicy` that defines a list of resource types to enforce a policy for `pods` and `cronjobs`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cosigned.sigstore.dev/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: image-policy
spec:
  match:
  - resource: jobs
    group: batch
    version: v1
  - resource: pods
    version: v1
  images:
  - glob: *
  authorities:
  - keyless:
      url: https://fulcio.mattmoor.dev/
      identities:
      - issuer: https://container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myco-prod/locations/*/clusters/*
        subject: https://k8s.io/namespaces/*/serviceaccounts/*

    tlog:
      url: https://rekor.mattmoor.dev
```

Besides the selection of specific types, the resources could also be selected using labels to filter them from other resources of the same type. In the next example, a `ClusterImagePolicy` enforce this policy on `cronjobs` with the label `prod=x-cluster1`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cosigned.sigstore.dev/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: image-cronjob-policy
spec:
  match:
      - resource: cronjobs
        group: batch
        version: v1
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            prod: x-cluster1
  images:
  - glob: *
  authorities:
  - keyless:
      url: https://fulcio.mattmoor.dev/
      identities:
      - issuer: https://container.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myco-prod/locations/*/clusters/*
        subject: https://k8s.io/namespaces/*/serviceaccounts/*

    tlog:
      url: https://rekor.mattmoor.dev
```

This feature only supports the selection of the following resource types: `pods, statefulsets, daemonsets, cronjobs, jobs, deployments and replicasets`.
