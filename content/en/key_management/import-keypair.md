### Import a Key Pair

To use a local key not generated by cosign for signing, the key must be imported. To use a key stored in a [KMS](/cosign/kms_support/), importing is not necessary and the key can be [specified by resource name](/cosign/kms_support/#signing-and-verification).

The importing of a key pair with `cosign` is as follows.

```shell
$ cosign import-key-pair --key opensslrsakey.pem
Enter password for private key:
Enter password for private key again:
Private key written to import-cosign.key
Public key written to import-cosign.pub
```

### Sign a container with imported keypair

The use of the imported key pair to sign an artifact with `cosign` is as follows.

```shell
$ cosign sign --key import-cosign.key $IMAGE_DIGEST
Enter password for private key:
tlog entry created with index: *****
Pushing signature to: *****
```
