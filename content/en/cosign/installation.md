The resulting binary will be placed at `$GOPATH/bin/cosign` (or `$GOBIN/cosign`, if set).

## With the Cosign binary or rpm/dpkg package

Download the binary for your platform at https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/latest.

```console
# binary
curl -O -L "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/latest/download/cosign-linux-amd64"
mv cosign-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/cosign
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cosign

# rpm
LATEST_VERSION=$(curl https://api.github.com/repos/sigstore/cosign/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d : -f2 | tr -d "v\", ")
curl -O -L "https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/latest/download/cosign-${LATEST_VERSION}.x86_64.rpm"

## Container Images

Signed release images are available at [`gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign`](http://gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign).
They are tagged with the release name (for example, `gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign:v2.0.2`).

You can get the latest release with `crane ls gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign | tail -1`. To list all versions, signatures and SBOMs:

```console
$ crane ls gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign
...
sha256-a95d7c4ab27e48aaf89253e0703014709129f010578be809b6c95ccee908fa1b.sbom
sha256-a95d7c4ab27e48aaf89253e0703014709129f010578be809b6c95ccee908fa1b.sig
...
v2.0.2
...
```

CI Built containers are published for every commit at `gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign/ci/cosign`.
They are tagged with the commit.
They can be found with `crane ls`:

```console
$ crane ls gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign/ci/cosign
749f896
749f896bb378aca5cb45c5154fc0cb43f6728d48
```

Further details and installation instructions for `crane` are available via https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/cmd/crane

## Verifying Cosign Releases

Before using a downloaded Cosign binary, it's important to verify its authenticity to ensure that it hasn't been tampered with. The Cosign binary is signed both with keyless signing and an artifact key. You first need to verify Cosign with the artifact key, since you will need Cosign to verify the keyless signature.

### Verifying Cosign with artifact key

#### Downloading The Update Framework (TUF) client

Before using Cosign, you will need to download and also initialize the TUF environment which allows you to ensure that your software artifacts are distributed securely and that any updates to these artifacts are signed and verified.

To do this, install and use [go-tuf](https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf)'s CLI tools:

```console
$ go install github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/cmd/tuf-client@latest
```

Then, obtain trusted root keys for Sigstore. You will use the 5th iteration of Sigstore's TUF root to start the root of trust, due to a backward incompatible change. The TUF client uses this root to start a chain of roots, and will download the latest, unexpired root as part of [its workflow](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/#update-root).

```console
curl -o sigstore-root.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sigstore/root-signing/main/ceremony/2022-10-18/repository/5.root.json
```

Note that you can verify the 5th TUF root against the 1st TUF root, which was signed in a publicly documented signing ceremony. However, due to the backward incompatible change, this requires manual verification steps. See the [Sigstore root repo](https://github.com/sigstore/root-signing) for more information.

#### Initializing TUF Environment

Then initialize the tuf client with the previously obtained root key and the remote repository;

```console
$ tuf-client init https://tuf-repo-cdn.sigstore.dev sigstore-root.json
```

#### Verifying with key

You will retrieve the artifact verification key from the trusted TUF repository and use it to verify the Cosign release.

```console
tuf-client get https://tuf-repo-cdn.sigstore.dev artifact.pub > artifact.pub

curl -o cosign-release.sig -L https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/download/<version>/cosign-<os>.sig
base64 -d cosign-release.sig > cosign-release.sig.decoded

curl -o cosign -L https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/download/<version>/cosign-<os>

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify artifact.pub -signature cosign-release.sig.decoded cosign
```

The `<version>`and `<os>` placeholders in the URLs should be replaced with the specific version and operating system that you want to download.

### Verifying Cosign with identity-based verification

Once you have verified Cosign with an artifact key, you can use Cosign to verify future releases of Cosign using identity-based verification. 

#### Verifying Cosign binary

To verify a Cosign binary, you will need to fetch the signature and certificate from GitHub.

```console
curl -o cosign-release.sig -L https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/download/<version>/cosign-<os>-keyless.sig
base64 -d cosign-release.sig > cosign-release.sig.decoded

curl -o cosign-release.pem -L https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/download/<version>/cosign-<os>-keyless.pem
base64 -d cosign-release.pem > cosign-release.pem.decoded

curl -o new-cosign -L https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/download/<version>/cosign-<os>

cosign verify-blob new-cosign --certificate cosign-release.pem.decoded --signature cosign-release.sig.decoded \
  --certificate-identity keyless@projectsigstore.iam.gserviceaccount.com --certificate-oidc-issuer https://accounts.google.com
```

#### Verify Cosign in container image

You can also verify a container image of Cosign. You can use [crane](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/blob/main/cmd/crane/README.md) to get the latest version of Cosign. You can skip the first two steps if you already have the container image.

```console
COSIGN_VERSION=$(crane ls gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign | tail -1)
COSIGN_DIGEST=$(crane digest gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign:$COSIGN_VERSION)

cosign verify gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign@$COSIGN_DIGEST \
  --certificate-identity keyless@projectsigstore.iam.gserviceaccount.com --certificate-oidc-issuer https://accounts.google.com
```
