```

The resulting binary will be placed at `$GOPATH/bin/cosign` (or `$GOBIN/cosign`, if set).

## With the Cosign binary or rpm/dpkg package

Check for the file in https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases

```console
# binary

They are tagged with the release name (for example, `gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign:v2.0.0`).
They can be found with `crane ls`:

```console
$ crane ls gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign
sha256-7e9a6ca62c3b502a125754fbeb4cde2d37d4261a9c905359585bfc0a63ff17f4.sig

CI Built containers are published for every commit at `gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign/ci/cosign`.
They are tagged with the commit.
They can be found with `crane ls`:

```console
$ crane ls gcr.io/projectsigstore/cosign/ci/cosign

749f896bb378aca5cb45c5154fc0cb43f6728d48
```

Further details and installation instructions for `crane` are available via https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/cmd/crane

## Downloading The Update Framework (TUF) client

Before using cosign, you will need to download and also initialize the TUF environment which allows you to ensure that your software artifacts are distributed securely and that any updates to these artifacts are signed and verified being installed.

To do this, install and use [go-tuf](https://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf)'s CLI tools:

```console
$ go install github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/cmd/tuf-client@latest
```

Then, obtain trusted root keys for Sigstore. You will use the 5th iteration of Sigstore's TUF root to start the root of trust, due to a backward incompatible change.

```console
curl -o sigstore-root.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sigstore/root-signing/main/ceremony/2022-10-18/repository/5.root.json
```

## Initializing TUF Environment

Then initialize the tuf client with the previously obtained root key and the remote repository;

```console
$ tuf-client init https://sigstore-tuf-root.storage.googleapis.com sigstore-root.json
```

## Verifying Cosign Releases

Before using a downloaded Cosign binary, it's important to verify its authenticity to ensure that it hasn't been tampered with. The Cosign binary is signed both with keyless signing and an artifact key. You first need to verify Cosign with the artifact key, since you will need Cosign to verify the keyless signature.

```console
tuf-client get https://sigstore-tuf-root.storage.googleapis.com cosign.pub > cosign.pub

curl -o cosign-release.sig -L https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/download/<version>/cosign-<os>.sig
base64 -d cosign-release.sig > cosign-release.sig.decoded

curl -o cosign -L https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/download/<version>/cosign-<os>

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify cosign.pub -signature cosign-release.sig.decoded cosign
```

The `<version>`and `<os>` placeholders in the URLs should be replaced with the specific version and operating system that you want to download.

## Releases

Releases are published in the Cosign repository under the [Releases page](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases), and hosted in the GCS bucket `cosign-releases`.

They can be reviewed with `gsutil`:

```console
$ gsutil ls gs://cosign-releases/v2.0.0
gs://cosign-releases/v2.0.0/cosign-darwin-amd64
gs://cosign-releases/v2.0.0/cosign-darwin-amd64.sig
