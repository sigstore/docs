## Identity Verification Cheat Sheet

### Verifying identity from OIDC issuers

To verify a signature created with an OIDC issuer, you need to know the following:

* `certificate-identity` : Valid values include email address, DNS names, IP addresses, and URIs
* `certificate-oidc-issuer`: the url associated with the OIDC issuer

| Issuer      | `certificate-oidc-issuer`         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| GitHub      | https://github.com/login/oauth    |
| GitLab      | https://gitlab.com                |
| Google      | https://accounts.google.com       |
| Microsoft   | https://login.microsoftonline.com |

If you are unsure of what values to expect, search the project's README, documentation, or website.

#### Verifying a signature created by a workflow

To verify a signature created by a workflow, you still need both the `certificate-identity` and the `certificate-oidc-issuer`, but they look a little different than when the signature is manually generated.

For the case of a signature created with GitHub actions:

| Issuer | `certificate-oidc-issuer`| `certificate-identity`|
