![Fulcio Overview](/sigstore_fulcio-horizontal-color.svg)

Fulcio is a free code signing Certificate Authority, built to make short-lived certificates available to anyone. Based on an OpenID Connect email address, Fulcio signs X.509 certificates valid for 10 minutes.

Fulcio was designed to run as a centralized, public-good instance, auditable by a certificate transparency log. Fulcio can also be deployed as a self-hosted service.

Fulcio is being developed as part of the sigstore project. Join us on our [Slack channel](https://sigstore.slack.com/) (need an [invite](https://links.sigstore.dev/slack-invite)?)

You can learn more about Fulcio in the [Fulcio repo](https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio) and the [repo docs](https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio/tree/main/docs).
